# CourseSchedule-webpage-Loader
This program reads the csv file with a list of Architecture courses being offered during a semester on to the webpage for the students 
to see the latest course schedule 

The data from the csv file is parsed to the webschedule.py program for formatting the data to be pushed on to the webapage.
